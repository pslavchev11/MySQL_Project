My Uni Project - MySQL course
-----------------------------------

Create a database for a forum with anonymous users. The forum has users who can be regular users or administrators. In the forum, articles are posted, and each article can have multiple comments. Articles are written only by administrators, while comments can be written by both regular users and administrators. Each user should be authenticated with a username and password. Create a way to track each comment chronologically or in an order of your choice. Add the necessary information to complete the table.
